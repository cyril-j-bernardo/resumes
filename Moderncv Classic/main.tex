I am Cyril Bernardo, a MS Mechanical Engineering student at New York University. Taking part in \CompanyName{}'s \ProgramName{} for \PositionName{} would be the next step in my career as an aspiring engineer. The \ProgramName{} advertises an eclectic program with rotations in a wide range of places; this is perfect for me as someone who has a diverse background in govenment research, laboratory research, technology, and leadership.

In the past, I have worked with developing tools that were dependent on optoelectronic systems. For a Mechatronics class, I created a solution to prevent vehicular heat stroke in pets and children by creating a system that would actuate based on stimuli to infrared sensors. This past summer, I developed a computer vision tool using live feed data from off-the-shelf webcams at Warby Parker. In my current internship at the NASA Johnson Space Center, I am processing acoustic data as well as developing multi-physics analyses in COMSOL. Although wide-in-breadth, all experiences combined has shown me what a broad field engineering is--and I've only scratched the surface.

The \ProgramName{} is one that boasts of the opportunity to work cross-functionally in diverse teams with an added benefit of furthering the technical exposure of the participant. If there is anything that my time in university has taught me, it is to always take the chance to do something different and to do something meaningful. I look forward to speaking with you to give and gain insight on my experience and the program.
